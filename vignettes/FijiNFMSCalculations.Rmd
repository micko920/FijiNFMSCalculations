# Introduction

This is my personal package. It contains some handy functions that I find useful
for my projects.

# Colours

Sometimes you want to generate shades of a colour. The `make_shades()` function
makes this easy!

```{r} 
d <- 10
```

If you want to see what the shades look like you can plot them using
`plot_colours()`.

```{r} 
summary(d)
```

This function is also useful for viewing any other palettes.

```{r} 

```

See also the [FijiNFMSCalculations::CalcEstEmDefor()] function.


```{r child="../man/CalcEstEmDefor.Rd"} 
```
